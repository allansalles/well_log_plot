# well_log_plot
Sharing my path into learning how to plot well log files. Well logs are import data used in oil and gas industry among other applications.

The data used is from the Brazilian National Agency of Oil and Gas, available online at: https://reate.cprm.gov.br/anp/TERRESTRE.
The well log is from Reconcavo Basin, Brazil.

I deeply thank @andymcdgeo for his content in github and youtube. His abbility and effort to share his knowledge was fundamental for me to take these first steps.
