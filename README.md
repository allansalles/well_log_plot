# well_log_plot
Sharing my path into learning how to plot well log files. Well logs are import data used in oil and gas industry among other applications.

I deeply thank @andymcdgeo for his content in github and youtube. His abbility and effort to share his knowledge was fundamental for me to take these first steps.
